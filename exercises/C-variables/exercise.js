// Program to print a `greeting` variable in the console 3 times
// Hopefully it is ok to be a bit creative with my solution and reduce code repetition :)

let greeting =
  ". My name is Andrew and Ive been learning how to code with <Code>YourFuture since 10/04/21";

for (let i = 1; i < 4; i++) {
  console.log(i + greeting);
}
